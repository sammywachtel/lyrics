# 🔍 Enter Key Debug Guide

I've added comprehensive debugging to help us identify the Enter key issue. Here's your step-by-step debugging approach:

## Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Open your app in the browser: `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:5176`
2. Open DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
3. Go to the **Console** tab
4. Clear the console (Cmd+K or Ctrl+L)

## Step 2: Test the Enter Key
1. **Switch to WYSIWYG mode** (if not already)
2. **Type some text** like: `Hello there.How are you?`
3. **Place cursor in the middle** (after "there.")
4. **Press Enter**
5. **Watch the console output**

## Step 3: Analyze Console Output

### Expected Debug Messages:
```
🔍 KeyDown Debug: {key: "Enter", isSourceMode: false, ...}
🔑 Enter key pressed - starting debug...
✅ Default prevented
📍 Selection: {selection: ..., rangeCount: 1, ...}
📏 Range before: {startContainer: ..., startOffset: ..., ...}
🗑️ Deleted contents
📝 Created new div: {element: div, className: "...", ...}
✅ Inserted div successfully
📍 Cursor positioned in new line
🔄 Change event triggered
🏗️ Final DOM state: {editorHTML: "...", children: [...]}
```

### What Each Message Tells Us:

**🔍 KeyDown Debug**: 
- Confirms the keydown event is triggered
- Check `isSourceMode: false` (should be false for WYSIWYG)
- Check `key: "Enter"` (confirms Enter was pressed)

**🔑 Enter key pressed**: 
- Confirms we entered the Enter handling code

**✅ Default prevented**: 
- Confirms `e.preventDefault()` worked

**📍 Selection**: 
- `rangeCount: 1` means we have a valid selection
- If `rangeCount: 0`, there's no cursor/selection

**📏 Range before**: 
- Shows where the cursor was positioned
- `startContainer` and `endContainer` show the DOM nodes
- `startOffset` shows cursor position

**📝 Created new div**: 
- Shows the div element we're trying to insert
- Check `className` to see if prosody analysis affects it

**✅ Inserted div successfully**: 
- Confirms DOM insertion worked

**🏗️ Final DOM state**: 
- Shows the final HTML content
- Check if the new div actually appears in `editorHTML`

## Step 4: Report What You See

Please run this test and tell me:

1. **Do you see ANY console messages?** (If no, the keydown handler isn't being called)
2. **Which debug messages appear?** (Copy/paste the console output)
3. **Where does it stop?** (Which message is the last one you see?)
4. **Visual result**: Does a line break appear in the editor?

## Step 5: Additional Tests

If the above doesn't work, try these variations:

### Test A: Source Mode
1. Switch to **Source mode**
2. Type text and press Enter
3. Does Enter work in Source mode?
4. Check console for: `⏭️ Skipping - in source mode`

### Test B: Focus Check
1. Click directly in the WYSIWYG editor before typing
2. Try the Enter test again
3. Check if focus affects the behavior

### Test C: Different Browsers
1. Try the same test in a different browser
2. Some browsers handle contentEditable differently

## Expected Issues to Look For:

❌ **No console output**: Handler not attached or event not firing
❌ **rangeCount: 0**: No cursor position detected
❌ **Error in insertion**: DOM manipulation failing
❌ **Missing final DOM changes**: New div not appearing in HTML

This debug output will tell us exactly where the Enter key handling is failing!
