# Graduated Quality Gate System

This document describes the sophisticated graduated quality gate rollout plan for the songwriting app. This approach starts permissive and progressively tightens to avoid blocking development while continuously improving code quality.

## Philosophy: Sustainable Quality Improvement

**Traditional Problem**: "Big Bang" quality gate implementations often block development, create massive technical debt, and frustrate developers.

**Our Solution**: A graduated 4-phase approach that:
- Maintains development velocity while improving quality
- Provides clear timelines and measurable progress
- Avoids rework through strategic baseline management
- Creates sustainable long-term quality culture

## System Overview

```
Phase 0 (1-3 days)    → Phase 1 (1-2 weeks)    → Phase 2 (2-4 weeks)    → Phase 3 (ongoing)
BASELINE               CHANGED-CODE-ONLY        RATCHET & EXPAND         NORMALIZE & HARDEN
├─ Document state      ├─ Strict for new code   ├─ Repo-wide enforcement ├─ All gates blocking
├─ Pin toolchain      ├─ Warn for legacy       ├─ Coverage ratchet      ├─ Branch protection
├─ Mandatory hooks    ├─ Per-file tracking     ├─ Module campaigns      ├─ Remove ignores
└─ One-command setup  └─ Gradual typing        └─ Tighten rules         └─ Full MyPy enforcement
```

## Current Status Assessment

**Excellent Baseline Position** - Most tools already achieve zero-error state:

| Tool | Current Status | Phase 0 Strategy |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| **ESLint** | 0 errors | ✅ Maintain baseline - no regressions allowed |
| **TypeScript** | 0 compilation errors | ✅ Maintain baseline - no regressions allowed |
| **Black** | 0 formatting issues | ✅ Maintain baseline - no regressions allowed |
| **isort** | 0 import issues | ✅ Maintain baseline - no regressions allowed |
| **flake8** | 0 linting errors | ✅ Maintain baseline - no regressions allowed |
| **Tests** | 251/251 passing | ✅ Maintain baseline + coverage tracking |
| **MyPy** | 90+ errors (disabled) | ⚠️ Document debt, plan gradual improvement |
| **Pre-commit** | Enforced | ✅ Mandatory - no bypass allowed |

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0: Baseline and Stabilization (1-3 days) ✅ CURRENT

**Goal**: Establish solid foundation without blocking development

**Strategy**:
- Pin toolchain versions to avoid drift
- Document current quality baseline
- Make pre-commit hooks mandatory (legacy issues allowed with baselines)
- Create one-command local validation

**Actions**:
- ✅ Update CI workflow with graduated enforcement messaging
- ✅ Document excellent baseline position for most tools
- ✅ Identify MyPy as primary technical debt (90+ typing errors)
- 🔄 Create `scripts/validate.sh` for consistent local validation
- 🔄 Update pre-commit config with staged approach
- 🔄 Create baseline files for legacy issues

**Success Criteria**:
- Pre-commit hooks run on all commits (no bypass)
- No regressions from current clean state
- Clear documentation of technical debt
- One-command environment setup

### Phase 1: Changed-Code-Only Enforcement (1-2 weeks)

**Goal**: Strict quality for new/modified code, warnings for legacy

**Strategy**:
- Enforce all rules for files touched in PR
- Generate warnings (not failures) for untouched legacy issues
- Begin typing campaign for new files only
- Implement per-module quality ratcheting

**Planned Actions**:
- Add git diff detection to CI workflow
- Create changed-files-only enforcement mode
- Enable MyPy for new files only
- Implement per-file quality tracking
- Add coverage baseline recording

**Tools Enhancement**:
- ESLint: Enforce only for changed files
- MyPy: Enable for new/modified Python files only
- Coverage: Record baseline, require no regression

### Phase 2: Ratchet and Expand Scope (2-4 weeks)

**Goal**: Progressive improvement through ratcheting system

**Strategy**:
- Repo-wide enforcement for tools already at baseline
- Coverage ratchet: gradual improvement required
- Module-by-module quality campaigns
- Tighten linter rules progressively

**Planned Actions**:
- Implement coverage ratchet system (gradual improvement)
- Module-by-module MyPy enablement campaign
- Tighten ESLint rules (enable additional checks)
- Add performance regression detection
- Security scanning integration

**Ratcheting Mechanism**:
```
Coverage Ratchet Example:
Current: 85% → Target: 87% (next sprint) → Target: 90% (month 2)
Quality Score = (Coverage + MyPy Modules + Clean Files) / Total Possible
```

### Phase 3: Normalize and Harden (ongoing)

**Goal**: Full strict enforcement with sustainable practices

**Strategy**:
- All quality gates blocking (no bypasses)
- Branch protection rules enforced
- Remove all per-file ignores
- Full MyPy enforcement repo-wide

**Final State**:
- Zero technical debt across all tools
- 100% test coverage (with reasonable exclusions)
- Full type annotation coverage
- Automated security scanning
- Performance regression detection

## Technical Implementation

### Local Validation Command

```bash
# scripts/validate.sh - One command to rule them all
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "🚀 Running complete quality validation..."

# Frontend validation
cd frontend
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm test -- --watchAll=false --coverage

# Backend validation
cd ../backend
black --check .
isort --check-only .
flake8 app/

# Phase progression checks
if [[ "$PHASE" -ge "1" ]]; then
  echo "Phase 1+: Running MyPy on changed files..."
  # mypy implementation for changed files only
fi

echo "✅ All quality checks passed!"
```

### Pre-commit Configuration Strategy

**Phase 0**: Strict validation, legacy tolerance with baseline files
**Phase 1**: Changed-files-only strict enforcement
**Phase 2**: Progressive ratcheting with module campaigns
**Phase 3**: Full strict enforcement

### CI Workflow Evolution

Each phase has dedicated CI workflow with:
- Clear phase identification in job names
- Helpful error messages with fix instructions
- Phase progression roadmap in outputs
- Baseline documentation and tracking

```
Quality Score Formula:
QS = (Clean Modules / Total Modules) * 100

Where Clean Module = {
  ESLint: 0 errors
  TypeScript: 0 errors
  MyPy: Full compliance
  Tests: >90% coverage
  Security: No high/critical issues
}

Target Progression:
Phase 0: Document baseline
Phase 1: QS maintenance + new code compliance
Phase 2: QS improvement 5% per sprint
Phase 3: QS = 100%
```

### Dashboard Tracking
- Quality score trending
