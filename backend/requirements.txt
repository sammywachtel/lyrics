# Production Python dependencies for the Backend (FastAPI)
#
# Guidelines:
# - Keep versions pinned to ensure reproducible builds.
# - Grouped by functional area; add short inline comments for context.
# - Development and testing tools belong in requirements-dev.txt (which includes this file).
# - When upgrading, update CHANGELOG/PR notes with rationale and breaking changes.
