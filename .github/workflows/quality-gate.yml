name: Quality Gate - Graduated Enforcement (Phase 0)

# GRADUATED QUALITY GATE SYSTEM
#
# This workflow implements a sophisticated, graduated quality gate approach that starts
# permissive and progressively tightens to avoid blocking development while improving quality.
#
# PHASE 0: BASELINE AND STABILIZATION (1-3 days)
# - Establish quality baseline (document current state)
# - Pin toolchain versions to avoid version drift
# - Mandatory pre-commit hooks (but allow legacy issues with baseline files)
# - One-command local validation
#
# PHASE 1: CHANGED-CODE-ONLY ENFORCEMENT (1-2 weeks)
# - Strict enforcement for modified files only
# - Warnings for unchanged legacy code
# - Gradual adoption of typing for new code
# - Per-module ratcheting system
#
# PHASE 2: RATCHET AND EXPAND SCOPE (2-4 weeks)
# - Repo-wide enforcement for most tools
# - Coverage ratchet (gradual improvement)
# - Tighten linter rules progressively
# - Module-by-module typing campaign
#
# PHASE 3: NORMALIZE AND HARDEN (ongoing)
# - All quality gates blocking
# - Branch protection rules
# - Remove per-file ignores
# - Full MyPy enforcement
#
# Benefits of this approach:
# - Avoids "big bang" quality gate implementations that block development
# - Provides clear graduation timeline and metrics
# - Maintains development velocity while improving quality
# - Creates sustainable long-term quality culture
